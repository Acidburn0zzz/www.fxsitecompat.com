For years, Mozilla has aimed to make the Web plug-in-free by enhancing Web standard technologies because plug-ins are negatively affecting the browser performance, security and user experience. From [animation effects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Animations/Using_CSS_animations), [video playback](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Using_HTML5_audio_and_video), [drag & drop file upload](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Drag_and_drop), [clipboard manipulation](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/09/flash-free-clipboard-for-the-web/) to [interactive 3D games](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games), [realtime video chat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/WebRTC), now everything can be done without a plug-in. Firefox offers a [build-in PDF reader](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/view-pdf-files-firefox-without-downloading-them), [DRM support](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/enable-drm) and [experimental Flash replacement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/Shumway) as well.

For that reason, the legacy [NPAPI plug-in](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/Plugins) support will be removed from Firefox by the end of 2016 with the exception of Adobe Flash Player. On the Windows 64-bit version of Firefox, [Flash and Silverlight are the only supported plug-ins](https://www.fxsitecompat.com/en-CA/docs/2015/64-bit-firefox-for-windows-is-officially-available-flash-and-silverlight-are-the-only-supported-plug-ins/). Web publishers must develop a plan to replace any plug-in content with alternative technologies. See [Mozilla's announcement](https://blog.mozilla.org/futurereleases/2015/10/08/npapi-plugins-in-firefox/) for details.

**Update**: Oracle has announced the [deprecation of the Java browser plug-in](https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/entry/moving_to_a_plugin_free).
