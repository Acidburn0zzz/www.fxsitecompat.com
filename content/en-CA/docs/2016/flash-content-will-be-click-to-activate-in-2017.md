As part of the ongoing [NPAPI plug-in deprecation](https://www.fxsitecompat.com/en-CA/categories/plugins/) in Firefox, Flash content will be defaulted to click-to-activate sometime in 2017, once some more advanced standard technologies like [`SharedArrayBuffer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SharedArrayBuffer), [WebAssembly](https://hacks.mozilla.org/category/webassembly/) and [WebGL 2.0](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL2RenderingContext) are implemented and shipped to public. To offer the best possible user experience, Web publishers must have a clear plan to move away from any Flash dependency.

Note that the support for plug-ins other than Flash has been removed already from [Firefox 52](https://www.fxsitecompat.com/en-CA/docs/2016/plug-in-support-has-been-dropped-other-than-flash/).
