Mozilla has shipped [Firefox 47 Beta and 48 Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/channel/) this week. Check out our [site compatibility documents](https://www.fxsitecompat.com/en-CA/docs/) for each version:

* [Firefox 47 Site Compatibility](https://www.fxsitecompat.com/en-CA/versions/47/)
* [Firefox 48 Site Compatibility](https://www.fxsitecompat.com/en-CA/versions/48/)

We're monitoring several sources to find regressions in Firefox 46 released this Tuesday but fortunately we haven't seen any serious problems so far. However, a WebGL regression and an `<input>` validation error have been discovered:

* [WebGL point sprites are not rendered properly in certain environments](https://www.fxsitecompat.com/en-CA/docs/2016/webgl-point-sprites-are-not-rendered-properly-in-certain-environments/)
* [`<input pattern>` now sets `u` flag for regular expressions](https://www.fxsitecompat.com/en-CA/docs/2016/input-pattern-now-sets-u-flag-for-regular-expressions/)

Please [let us know](https://www.fxsitecompat.com/en-CA/contribute/) if you noticed any other changes or regressions!
