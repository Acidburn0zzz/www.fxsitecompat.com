      title: "Bug 1228841 - Remove support for conditional catch expressions"
---
The support for non-standard [conditional `catch` clauses](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/try...catch#Conditional_catch_clauses) will be removed in the future. Use the standard [`if...else`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else) statement instead, as explained in the MDN document.
