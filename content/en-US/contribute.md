## Test your site

It is important to find and fix Firefox regressions before Firefox users visit your *broken* site. Mozilla is offering [Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/developer/), formerly known as Aurora, so please use this alpha version on a daily basis to develop and test your site or Web app.
