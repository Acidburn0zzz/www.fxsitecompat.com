## Who we are

The Firefox Site Compatibility Working Group is a community initiative that tackles the backward compatibility and regressions of Firefox through monitoring sources, providing documents and promoting engagement with Web developers. While Mozilla's [Compatibility team](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Compatibility) is doing a fantastic job in improving cross-browser compatibility, there are no staffers intensively covering compatibility issues in Firefox itself, so we are here to serve voluntarily. Our missions are to:

* Improve Firefox user experience by preventing site breakages
* Engage more with Web developers through various channels
* Make Firefox a leading brand and robust Web platform for the millions of users

## Why important

The world of the Web is rapidly evolving in this HTML5 era. Mozilla is a pioneer in rich, modern Web technologies and Firefox is trying to keep up with the changes made to standard specifications such as HTML, CSS, DOM and ECMAScript. As part of the standardization efforts, Firefox is also dropping a bunch of the legacy, non-standard features originated from the Netscape browser. Those changes, that we are covering here, are necessary for a better Web.

It's obviously impossible for Mozilla to test Firefox with all the sites around the world, and that's why Firefox releases sometimes contain regressions that may break your site or application. For whatever reason, site breakages lead to customer defection from Firefox, therefore we believe that solving regressions and communicating changes in advance are crucial to the success of the Firefox ecosystem. It's also important especially for [Firefox OS](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/os/) to get bugs fixed as early as possible, because the system on user devices may rarely or never be updated depending on the market or Internet connectibility, unlike the standalone Firefox browser. With the [help of Web developers](/en-US/contribute/) *like you*, most of Firefox regressions can hopefully be found and fixed during the alpha or beta cycle. 

## What we do

We have two focus areas:

* **Backward compatibility**: Every 6 week, while Mozilla is preparing a new [Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/developer/), we post a series of [site compatibility documents](/en-US/docs/) to let Web developers know backward incompatible changes in that release. At that point, you should have at least 12 weeks to make necessary changes to your code before it goes public.
* **Regressions**: Every 6 week, after a final version of Firefox hits the streets, we spend time finding regressions by monitoring various channels including [Firefox Support Forum](https://support.mozilla.org/questions/firefox), [Firefox Input](https://input.mozilla.org/) and [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/). If a potential issue is found, we analyze it, report it to Bugzilla if not filed yet, then encourage Firefox developers to fix it. Web developers can be notified of the issue with a workaround if any by following us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/FxSiteCompat), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/FxSiteCompat) or [Google+](https://plus.google.com/+FxSiteCompatibility).

While we may cover cross-browser compatibility or interoperability on our blog, those topics are not our main focus. Mozilla's Compatibility team is doing excellent work in that field, so it's recommended to follow their activities as well.

## Who we exactly are

This initiative is led by [Kohei Yoshino](https://mozillians.org/u/kohei.yoshino), a long-time Mozilla contributor. He has been an active Mozilla community member since 2002, and also worked for Mozilla Japan as a full-time employee from 2004 to 2012. Help is always welcome! See the [Contribute](/en-US/contribute/) page for what you can do. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach us out at any time via one of our social media or [email](mailto:kohei@fxsitecompat.com).
