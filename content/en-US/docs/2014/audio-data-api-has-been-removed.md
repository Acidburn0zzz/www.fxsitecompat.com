---
The experimental, non-standard [Audio Data API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Introducing_the_Audio_API_Extension), which has been deprecated since [Firefox 22](https://www.fxsitecompat.com/en-US/versions/22/) and disabled since [Firefox 28](https://www.fxsitecompat.com/en-US/versions/28/), is now completely removed. The standardized [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web_Audio_API) should be used instead.
