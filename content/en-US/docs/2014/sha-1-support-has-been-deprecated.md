The support for SSL certificates using the [weak SHA-1 hash algorithm](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Security/Weak_Signature_Algorithm) has been deprecated. The [Web Console will log a warning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Web_Console#Security_warnings_and_errors) when a SHA-1 certificate is found.
