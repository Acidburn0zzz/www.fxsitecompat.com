Mozilla has defined the [plugin whitelist policy](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2014/02/28/update-on-plugin-activation/) since the Click-to-Activate functionality was [added to Firefox 26](https://www.fxsitecompat.com/en-US/docs/2013/java-is-now-defaulted-to-click-to-activate/). The whitelist has been implemented in Firefox 30 and plug-ins are now defaulted to click-to-activate except the registered ones. The complete list of whitelisted plug-ins is available in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19JIQiaS9mJgkKQ07ax2KH7syRCgxt2dCCxcBD56PiQc/edit?usp=sharing).
