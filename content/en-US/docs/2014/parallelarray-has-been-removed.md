[`ParallelArray`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ParallelArray), an experimental feature introduced with Firefox 17 and [disabled with Firefox 22](https://www.fxsitecompat.com/en-US/versions/22/) in the Beta, Release and ESR channels, has been removed in favor of [ParallelJS (PJS)](http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2013/10/29/pjs-roadmap/). PJS is still [under developement](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=801869) and currently only available in the Nightly channel.
