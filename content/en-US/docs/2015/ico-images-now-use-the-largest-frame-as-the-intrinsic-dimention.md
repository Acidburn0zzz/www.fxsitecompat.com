Previously, the dimention of ICO format images (favicons) with multiple frames was based on the smallest frame, which is usually 16Ã—16px. Starting with Firefox 44, the largest frame is used instead as the intrinsic image dimention. 

While this change should not negatively affect the browser's UI including tabs and bookmarks, ICO images embedded on a Web page, using `<img>` elements, CSS `background-image` or other properties, might be displayed in different sizes unless the the `width` and `height` are set.
