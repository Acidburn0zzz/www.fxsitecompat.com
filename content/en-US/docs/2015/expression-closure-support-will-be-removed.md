---
The support for the non-standard [expression closures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Expression_closures) (shorthand function syntax), [deprecated since Firefox 37](https://www.fxsitecompat.com/en-US/docs/2015/expression-closures-are-now-deprecated/), will be removed in the future. Use the standard [arrow function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions) syntax instead.
