The support for the legacy, non-standard [array comprehensions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Array_comprehensions) and [generator comprehensions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Generator_comprehensions), introduced with JavaScript [1.7](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/New_in_JavaScript/1.7) and [1.8](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/New_in_JavaScript/1.8) respectively, will be removed in the near future. Each new syntax proposed for ECMAScript is available since Firefox 30, though it's still uncertain whether those will be standardized.

**Update**: The initial draft of this document said array/generator comprehensions would be removed, but the bug has been updated to only remove the legacy syntaxes for now.
