---
The support for the `String.prototype.contains` method, [deprecated since Firefox 40](https://www.fxsitecompat.com/en-US/docs/2015/string-prototype-contains-has-been-renamed-to-includes/), will be removed in the near future. Due to site compatibility issues, it has been renamed to [`includes`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/includes).
