---
The [expression closure](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Expression_closures) syntax, introduced with JavaScript 1.8, is now considered deprecated and will be removed in the near future. Consider using the ECMAScript 6 [arrow function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions) syntax instead.
