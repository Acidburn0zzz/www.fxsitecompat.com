---
The [expression closure](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Expression_closures) syntax, introduced with JavaScript 1.8, is now considered deprecated and will be [removed in the near future](https://www.fxsitecompat.com/en-US/docs/2015/expression-closure-support-will-be-removed/). Use the ECMAScript 6 [arrow function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions) syntax instead.
