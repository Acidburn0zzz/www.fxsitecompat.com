The deprecated [`hasPermission`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PushManager/hasPermission) method has been removed from the [`PushManager`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PushManager) interface in favor of the standardized [`permissionState`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PushManager/permissionState) method.
