Firefox 42 has implemented the Tracking Protection functionality in the Private Browsing mode, that protects users from third-party tracking across the Web. This may particularly affect advertisements, Web analytics and social media buttons. Web developers are encouraged to test this new feature with [Firefox Beta or Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/), and make sure the essential content on your site is displayed properly. See the following reference articles for details.
