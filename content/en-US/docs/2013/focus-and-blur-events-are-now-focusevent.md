The [`focus`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Reference/Events/focus) and [`blur`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Reference/Events/blur) events have been updated to be instances of the [`FocusEvent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FocusEvent) interface instead of the [`Event`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event) interface. This will comply with the DOM Level 3 Events spec.
