---
Support for the `multipart` property and `multipart/x-mixed-replace` responses has been removed from [`XMLHttpRequest`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest). This was a Firefox-only feature that was never standardized. [Server-Sent Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Server-sent_events), [Web Sockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebSockets) or inspecting `responseText` from progress events can be used instead.
