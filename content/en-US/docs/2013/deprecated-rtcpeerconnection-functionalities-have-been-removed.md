---
Some non-standard functionalities deprecated since [Firefox 24](https://www.fxsitecompat.com/en-US/versions/24/) have been removed from the (currently prefixed) [`RTCPeerConnection`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection) interface. Those include the `localStreams`, `remoteStreams`, `readyState`, `onicechange` and `ongatheringchange` attributes, as well as calling `createAnswer` or `createOffer` without `failureCallback`.
