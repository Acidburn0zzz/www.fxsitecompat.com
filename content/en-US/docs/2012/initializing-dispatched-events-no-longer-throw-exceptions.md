Previously, executing [`initEvent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/event.initEvent) on events dispatched with [`dispatchEvent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget.dispatchEvent) thrown an exception. The behavior has been changed to do nothing like the other browsers.
