---
Previously, Firefox was incorrectly accepting length values, such as a value with a unit like `10px`, in addition to numeric values, for the `matrix` and `matrix3d` [transform functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform-function). This behavior has been fixed to comply with the spec so a parse error will be returned for length values.
