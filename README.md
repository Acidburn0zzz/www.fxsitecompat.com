# FxSiteCompat.com

The source of our [FxSiteCompat.com](https://www.fxsitecompat.com/) site powered by [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/).

This site is listed in Hugo's [Site Showcase](https://gohugo.io/showcase/) so you *may refer to* our multilingual templates for your own project. However, the code is not open source and the design is not intended to be used as a Hugo theme. You can find free Hugo themes at the [Theme Gallery](http://themes.gohugo.io/) instead.
